# FeBFSK
An undergraduate binary FSK project that, 80% of the time, works 100% of the time

This is an undergraduate project I did as part of my university's requirements. It includes encoding and 
decoding and modulation and demodulation functions of an encoding standard I created. It's notable beyond simple 
audio BFSK implementations for including a rest frequency, variable bit length and using a mark tone to separate the bits, 
in an attempt to increase throughput of data.

I can't guarantee updates on this project after it's complete - that'll really only happen if I feel like
updating it at some point.
